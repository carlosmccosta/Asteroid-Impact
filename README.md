## Asteroid impact on Earth
This simulation was made to show the influence of gravity from both Earth and the Moon in the surrounding objects.
The simulation starts with an asteroid with an initial trajectory that would miss Earth, but with the combined effect of Earth's and Moon's gravity, along with their relative position, the asteroid was deviated to a collision course, and after several orbits around Earth, it eventually collided.
After the collision, and to simulate an apocalyptic event, several other asteroids were added in a direct collision course to completely obliterate Earth.
